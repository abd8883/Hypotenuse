# Hypotenuse

## My code calculate the hypotenuse of right tringle using Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²)
## Contains two static methods:
- sqrt (double n) : Which use Newton's law to compute the sqrt of number with 10 ^ -15 of precision .
- hypotenuse (double a, double b) : Compute the hypotenuse of the right tringle.
